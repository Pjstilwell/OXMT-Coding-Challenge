Should
- Depending on the situation, may need authentication
- Add End to end testing

Could
- Store inputted data and reuse it computing subsequent zscores. This expands our

- Move the Constants.OUTLIER_THRESHOLD to be either an environment variable or 
an input from the user, since we may want to vary it 

Nice to have
- Present a front end UI with graphical dashboards to point our outlying data
- A response with suggestions to fix the errors, "Did you mean..."
